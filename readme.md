## src folder
- epidemic.js: js file contains the implementaion that simulates the spread of disease (mainly for visualization).
- graph_plotting.js: algorithm for visualize the graphs that works with canvas(mainly for visualization).
- index.html: main html file that simulates the animation of spread of disease(mainly for visualization). It can animate 5 different networks: ER graph, regular lattices, star graph, complete graph and tree, with customizable gamma, beta, number of nodes and iterations.
- ploter.r: for visualize the results obtained from html/js implementation as reference.
- solution.ipynb: Main solution file that contains the impelemnentation of two tasks, the simulation of disease and prove of theorem of Charkrabarty finding the threshold.
